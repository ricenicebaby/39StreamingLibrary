# 39StreamingLibrary
GitHub respository for 39StreamingLibrary.

In this repository you'll find all of the files that help make https://39streaminglibrary.azurewebsites.net/

You'll find: the code/logic behind this project, it's progress, and additionally database schema. 

Thing(s) to note:
- In the "appsettings.json" file, because I don't know how to encrypt/hide the password yet, I commented out the connection string that connects to the actual server and
database in Azure and censored the user and password. Instead, I commented in the connection string to my local database; of course, nothing will be displayed when you build and run it. Though the website itself is attached to the Azure database, so you can see it connected and fully running properly
there!
